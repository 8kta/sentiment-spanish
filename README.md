# How does it work?

sentiment-spanish uses convolutional neural networks to predict the sentiment of spanish sentences. The model was trained using over *800000* reviews of users of the pages *eltenedor, decathlon, tripadvisor, filmaffinity and ebay*.
This reviews were extracted using web scraping with the project [opinion-reviews-scraper](https://github.com/sentiment-analysis-spanish/opinion-reviews-scraper)

Using the rate in the user reviews we trained the model to learn from the language in them. For that we use the libraries Keras and Tensorflow. We achieved a validation accuracy (accuracy over fresh data, no used for training) of 87%.
For more details regarding the training of the neural network model check the repo [sentiment-analysis-model-neural-network](https://github.com/sentiment-analysis-spanish/sentiment-analysis-model-neural-network) 

# Install and use

First to install the package

```
pip install sentiment-analysis-spanish
```

You will also need keras and tensorflow

```
pip install keras tensorflow
```

Import the package

```
from sentiment_analysis_spanish import sentiment_analysis

```

run the sentiment analysis:

```
sentiment = sentiment_analysis.SentimentAnalysisSpanish()
print(sentiment.sentiment("me gusta la tombola es genial"))

```

you will see that it outputs 

```
1
```
For instance if you use the text
